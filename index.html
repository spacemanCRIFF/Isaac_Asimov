  <div class="box1">Isaac Asimov was an American writer and professor of biochemistry 
    at Boston University. He was widely known for his works of science fiction and popular science.
    Asimov wrote a library of hard science fiction, including hundreds of books. Asimov's most famous work 
    is the award-winning Foundation series.  His other major series are the Galactic Empire series and the 
    Robot series.  Along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, 
    Asimov was considered one of the "Big Three" science fiction writers during his lifetime.

  <div class="box2">Asimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as much nonfiction. 
    Most of his popular science books explain concepts in a historical way, going as far back 
    as possible,<br> to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage.
    Examples include Guide to Science, the three-volume set Understanding Physics, and Asimov's 
    Chronology <br>of Science and Discovery. He wrote on numerous other scientific and non-scientific 
    topics, such as chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, world history, and literary critique.</div>
